			<h2><b>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</b></h2>
			<p>I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bus restaurant in Kings Cross,
			Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>
			<p>This recipe is what I call a very special breakfast just look at the ingredients to see why It has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
			<h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
			<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
			<ul class="lead">
				<li><p>2 eggs</p></li>
				<li><p>1 table spoon of butter (10g)</p></li>
				<li><p>1/3 cup of cream (2 3/4 fl ounces)</p></li>
				<li><p>A pinch of salt</p></li>
				<li><p>Freshly milled black pepper</p></li>
				<li><p>3 fresh chives (chopped)</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Whisk eggs cream, and salt in a bowl.</p></li>
				<li><p>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (taking care not to burn the butter).</p></li>
				<li><p>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</p></li>
				<li><p>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and it cook for another 20 seconds.</p></li>
				<li><p>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</p></li>
				<li><p>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.
